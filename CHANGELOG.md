## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - {{DATE}}

The major update since the previous release is the introduction of the
`#[dynify]` macro, which can significantly reduce boilerplate codes when
defining async methods that have multiple lifetimes in their signatures.

### Added

- Support downcasting a `Buffered` pointer ([#10]).
- Support unwrapping a `Buffered` pointer ([#11]).
- Add a helper macro `#[dynify]` for trait transformations ([#12]).
- Support transformations of function items for `#[dynify]` ([#13]).

## [0.1.0] - 2025-07-06

The main purpose of this release is to address unsoundness and introduce
breaking changes early to prevent further issues. Consequently, it includes few
changes.

### Added

- Implement `Emplace` for `&mut MaybeUninit<[u8; N]>` ([#2]).
- Implement `Emplace` for `SmallVec` ([#6]).

### Changed

- Add `#[must_use]` for `Slot`, `from_fn!()` and `from_closure()` ([#4]).

### Removed

- (**breaking**) Remove `Emplace` implementations for `&mut [u8; N]`,
  `&mut [u8]` and `&mut Vec<u8>` ([#2]).

### Fixed

- Make the compilation passes when `default-features = false` ([#5]).
